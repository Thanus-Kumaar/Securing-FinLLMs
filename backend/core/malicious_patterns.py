# This file contains a hard-coded list of malicious patterns for prompt injection.
# We do not rely on an external dataset for this filter for several reasons:
# 1. New attack vectors are constantly emerging, making a static dataset quickly outdated.
# 2. A hard-coded, application-specific filter is deterministic and reliable.
# 3. This approach demonstrates a "defense-in-depth" strategy, as it complements the LLM's own safety mechanisms.
# 4. It ensures our most critical security checks are always active and not dependent on a third-party service.
